            In an effort to provide clean and safe drinking water to the entire village, a mineral water plant with a capacity 
            of 1,000 liters per hour is set to be constructed in the first half of the year. This initiative aims to ensure that 
            the villagers have access to high-quality drinking water at affordable costs, where the nominal charges collected 
            will be utilized to cover the maintenance expenses of the plant. Geology tests were conducted on January 10th, 2018, 
            to determine the most suitable location for drilling a bore well, which will serve as the water source for the plant. 
            After careful analysis and planning, the construction work is scheduled to commence in the fourth week of February. 
            Once operational, the mineral water plant will significantly improve the villagers' access to safe drinking water, 
            promoting better health and well-being throughout the community.
